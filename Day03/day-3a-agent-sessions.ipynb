It's one of the most dynamic areas of AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key recent trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI for Uncovering Novel Biological Targets:** AI is being used to analyze massive datasets (genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, clinical data) to identify new genes, proteins, or pathways that are implicated in diseases. This is crucial because many diseases still lack effective treatments due to a lack of well-understood targets.\n    *   **Example:** Companies are using AI to identify previously unknown interactions in disease pathways that could serve as new drug targets.\n*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":** AI models can assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be amenable to drug intervention, saving significant time and resources on targets that are unlikely to yield results.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Molecule Design:** This is a huge area of growth. Generative AI models (similar to those that create text or images) are now being used to design entirely new molecules with desired properties.\n    *   **How it works:** These models learn the \"rules\" of chemistry and can generate novel molecular structures that are predicted to bind to a specific target and have desirable pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion).\n    *   **Examples:** Companies are designing novel small molecules, peptides, and even antibodies from scratch using AI.\n*   **Optimizing Existing Molecules:** AI can also take existing drug candidates and suggest modifications to improve their efficacy, reduce toxicity, or enhance their stability.\n\n**3. AI in Preclinical and Clinical Development:**\n\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are improving their ability to predict how well a drug will work and what side effects it might have *before* it enters human trials. This helps prioritize the most promising candidates.\n*   **Designing Better Clinical Trials:** AI can help optimize clinical trial design by:\n    *   **Patient Stratification:** Identifying patient subgroups who are most likely to respond to a drug, leading to more efficient trials and potentially enabling personalized medicine approaches.\n    *   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI can help forecast the likelihood of success for a trial, allowing for early adjustments or termination of failing studies.\n    *   **Synthetic Control Arms:** In some cases, AI is being explored to create \"synthetic\" control groups from existing real-world data, potentially reducing the need for large placebo groups.\n\n**4. Leveraging Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n\n*   **Unlocking Insights from Diverse Data Sources:** AI is essential for extracting meaningful insights from the vast and complex RWD sources (EHRs, insurance claims, wearables, patient registries). This can inform drug discovery by revealing disease progression patterns, unmet needs, and potential therapeutic strategies.\n*   **Post-Market Surveillance:** AI can monitor drug safety and effectiveness in real-world populations after approval, identifying rare side effects or new indications.\n\n**5. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is heavily used to identify cancer-driving mutations, design targeted therapies, and predict response to immunotherapy.\n*   **Neuroscience:** AI is helping to understand complex neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and to design drugs for these conditions.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being employed to rapidly identify potential antiviral or antibacterial compounds, especially in response to emerging threats.\n\n**Key Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront, including:\n\n*   **AI-first drug discovery companies:** Insilico Medicine, Atomwise, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI.\n*   **Big Pharma adopting AI:** Companies like Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and others are heavily investing in AI platforms and partnerships for drug discovery.\n*   **Tech giants:** Google (DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs) and Microsoft are also making significant contributions.\n\n**In essence, AI is transforming drug discovery from a largely trial-and-error process into a more predictable, data-driven, and efficient endeavor. It's not about replacing scientists but augmenting their capabilities to discover and develop new medicines faster and more effectively.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in my previous response, which was **\"De Novo Drug Design and Optimization\"**, particularly focusing on **Generative AI for Molecule Design**.\n\nLet's dive deeper into this exciting area:\n\n**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n\n\"De novo\" is Latin for \"from the beginning.\" De novo drug design refers to the process of creating novel drug molecules that don't exist in nature or in current drug libraries. Instead of screening vast collections of existing compounds, de novo design aims to build molecules with specific, desired properties from scratch.\n\n**How Generative AI Revolutionizes De Novo Design:**\n\nTraditionally, de novo design involved complex computational chemistry techniques and expert human intuition. Generative AI, especially deep learning models, has significantly advanced this by:\n\n1.  **Learning Chemical \"Language\" and Rules:** Generative AI models, often based on architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are trained on enormous datasets of known chemical structures. Through this training, they learn:\n    *   **Molecular Grammar:** The fundamental rules of how atoms connect to form stable molecules.\n    *   **Chemical Properties:** The relationship between a molecule's structure and its physical, chemical, and biological properties (e.g., solubility, binding affinity, toxicity).\n    *   **Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR):** How changes in molecular structure affect biological activity.\n\n2.  **Generating Novel Molecular Structures:** Once trained, these AI models can be \"prompted\" or \"conditioned\" to generate new molecular structures that meet specific criteria. This is like asking an artist to paint a picture of a specific scene; you provide the parameters, and the AI generates a unique output.\n    *   **Key Criteria for Generation:**\n        *   **Target Binding:** The most crucial criterion is that the generated molecule should be predicted to bind effectively to a specific disease target (e.g., an enzyme or receptor).\n        *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties (ADMET):** The molecule should ideally have good absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and low toxicity.\n        *   **Synthesizability:** The molecule should be practically synthesizable in a lab, meaning it can be created using known chemical reactions.\n        *   **Novelty:** The molecule should ideally be unique, to avoid existing patents and potentially offer a new mechanism of action.\n\n3.  **Iterative Design and Optimization:** The process isn't usually a one-shot deal.\n    *   The AI generates a set of candidate molecules.\n    *   These candidates are then evaluated using predictive models (which can also be AI-driven) for binding affinity, ADMET properties, and synthesizability.\n    *   Based on the evaluation results, the AI can be fine-tuned or the generation process can be re-run with refined parameters to improve the candidates. This iterative loop significantly speeds up the design process.\n\n**Types of Generative AI Models Used:**\n\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Learn a compressed representation of molecules and can then decode it to generate new ones.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) compete, with the generator trying to create realistic molecules and the discriminator trying to distinguish them from real ones.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Can be used to guide the generation process towards molecules that optimize specific properties.\n*   **Transformer Models:** Increasingly being adapted from natural language processing to understand and generate molecular sequences (like SMILES strings) or graph representations of molecules.\n\n**Benefits of AI-Driven De Novo Design:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Dramatically accelerates the process of identifying potential drug candidates compared to traditional methods.\n*   **Novelty:** Enables the exploration of chemical space that might not be considered by human chemists.\n*   **Efficiency:** Reduces the need for large-scale physical screening of compound libraries.\n*   **Customization:** Allows for the design of molecules tailored to specific targets and desired properties.\n*   **Cost Reduction:** By identifying promising candidates earlier and reducing the number of failed experiments, AI can lower the overall cost of drug discovery.\n\n**Examples of Applications:**\n\n*   **Designing inhibitors for enzymes involved in cancer.**\n*   **Creating small molecules that can cross the blood-brain barrier for neurological diseases.**\n*   **Developing novel antibiotics to combat drug-resistant bacteria.**\n*   **Designing modulators for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a major class of drug targets.**\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n*   **\"Garbage In, Garbage Out\":** The quality of generated molecules depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data.\n*   **Synthesizability:** Ensuring that AI-generated molecules are actually feasible to synthesize in a laboratory remains a significant challenge.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions must always be validated through rigorous laboratory experiments. AI is a powerful tool, but it doesn't replace the need for wet-lab science.\n*   **Explainability:** Understanding *why* an AI model designed a particular molecule can be difficult, which can impact trust and further development.\n\nIn summary, generative AI for de novo drug design is a frontier in pharmaceutical research, offering the potential to discover entirely new classes of medicines by intelligently designing molecules from the ground up, guided by specific therapeutic goals.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of **Generative AI for De Novo Drug Design**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
