# Kaggle-5d-AI-Agents-Intensive-Course-Google-2025
This repo contains my work from Kaggle's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google. It includes end-to-end examples of building intelligent multi-agent systems, integrating LLMs, tool use, and retrieval-augmented workflows using Google Cloud Vertex AI.

### Duration : Monday, November 10 - Friday, November 14


### Course Content 

**What’s being covered?**

**Day 1: Introduction to Agents**
Explore the foundational concepts of AI agents, their defining characteristics, and how agentic architectures differ from traditional LLM applications, laying the groundwork for building intelligent, autonomous systems.

**Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP**
Dive into the world of tools, understanding how AI agents can "take action" by leveraging external functionalities and APIs, and explore the ease of discovering and using tools offered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Day 3: Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory**
Explore how to build AI agents that can remember past interactions and maintain context. Learn how to implement short-term and long-term memory to create more robust agents capable of handling complex, multi-turn tasks.

**Day 4: Agent Quality**
Learn to build robust and reliable AI agents by mastering the critical disciplines of evaluating and improving agents. This session will cover observability, logging, and tracing to provide visibility, alongside key metrics and evaluation strategies to optimize agent performance.

**Day 5: Prototype to Production**
Go beyond local testing and learn to deploy and scale AI agents for real-world use. This session will cover the best practices for deploying your agents so that others can use them, including how to create a truly multi-agent system with the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.

### How the Course Works:

The course is designed to be flexible and interactive, allowing you to learn at your own pace while benefiting from live sessions and community engagement.
- **Daily Content Release**: New assignments will be posted each day on this Kaggle course page - your primary source for all course materials.
- **Assignment Notifications (Fast Follow)**: Given the large number of participants, links to all assignment materials including whitepapers, codelabs and podcast episodes — will also be shared on the Kaggle Discord and sent via follow-up email shortly after being posted.
- **Support & Discussion** : Join the discussion on our dedicated Discord channels to connect with other learners, ask questions, and get support from Google researchers and engineers who will be monitoring the channels throughout the week.
- **Daily Livestreams**: Join Kanchana Patlolla and Anant Nawalgaria live each day starting Monday, November 10th at 11 AM PT / 8 PM CET / 12:30 AM IST on Kaggle’s YouTube channel. They will be joined by special guests from Google, NVIDIA, Cohere and more. After each session, recordings will be shared on Discord.
- **Course Completion**: To get the most out of this intensive, we recommend completing all course materials including whitepapers, podcasts and codelabs before starting the capstone project. Assignments are provided for your learning, so assignment submissions are not required and you can complete them at your own pace.
- **Capstone Project**: On the final day, you’ll have the chance to apply everything you’ve learned by building your own AI agent. By participating in the capstone project, you will earn a badge on Kaggle.
- **Community**: We want this community to be positive and supportive. Please follow Kaggle’s community guidelines found here.

### Set-up 
To ensure you are ready for the course, please complete these essential setup steps:

 - Kaggle account: Sign up for a Kaggle account and learn how Notebooks work. Make sure to phone verify your account, it’s necessary for the course’s codelabs.
 - AI Studio account: Sign up for an AI Studio account and ensure you can generate an API key.
 - Kaggle Discord: Sign up for a Discord account and join us on the Kaggle Discord server. We have the following channels dedicated to this event:
 - #5dgai-announcements: find official course announcements and livestream recordings.
 - #5dgai-introductions: introduce yourself and meet other participants from around the world.
 - #5dgai-question-forum: Discord forum-style channel for asking questions and discussions about the assignments.
 - #5dgai-general-chat: a general channel to discuss course materials and network with other participants.
 - Please note that if you would like to post on other channels on the Kaggle discord you will need to link your Kaggle account to discord here: https://kaggle.com/discord/confirmation.
