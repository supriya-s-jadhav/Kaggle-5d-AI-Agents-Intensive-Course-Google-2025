# Day 2 (Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP))

Today’s whitepaper focuses on external tools functions that allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data beyond its training set and introduces best practices for designing effective tools. You'll learn about MCP, highlighting its architectural components, communication layer, risks and enterprise readiness gaps.

In today's codelabs, you will create custom tools for your agents by turning your own Python functions into actions your agent can perform. You'll also use MCP and implement long-running operations where an agent can pause tool calls while waiting for human approval, before resuming.
